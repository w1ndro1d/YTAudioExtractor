Simple python scripts to download .mp3 audio from desired YouTube video links, using PyTube and MoviePy libraries.

Run the "audioextract.py" for a single video.
Run the "playlistaudioextract.py" for videos in a playlist. Please make sure the playlist is publicly visible!

The downloaded mp3 files will be stored locally in "MyPlaylist" folder inside the project directory.

Make sure to delete this folder "MyPlaylist" before proceeding to download mp3s for your next lot of video(s) as it might not work with an already existing "MyPlaylist" folder.
